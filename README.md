## Notes for my future me

Considering that it will take some time to complete this challenge (30 days, ~~probably much more~~), there are some things I need to remember:

* The files that I'll be working on must be named with the suffix "my" between the main name and file extension, like: index.my.html, etc.
* Read this notes.

The starter content was taken from @wesbos's [repo](https://github.com/wesbos/JavaScript30).
